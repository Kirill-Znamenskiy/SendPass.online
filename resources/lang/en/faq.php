<br/>SendPass exists as a better alternative to emailing passwords.
<br/>Emailing passwords is inherently insecure. The greatest risks include:
<br/>
<br/>Emailed passwords are usually sent with context to what they go to or can potentially be derived from email username, domain etc...
<br/>Email is inherently insecure and can be intercepted at multiple points by malicious entitities.
<br/>Emailed passwords live in perpetuity (read: forever) in email archives
<br/>Passwords in email can be retrieved and used later on if an email account is stolen, cracked etc..
<br/>By using PasswordPusher, you bypass all of this. For each password posted, a unique URL is generated that only you will know. Additionally, passwords expire after a predefined set of views are hit or time passed. Once expired, passwords are unequivocally deleted.
